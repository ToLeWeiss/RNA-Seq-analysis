This workflow performs a differential gene expression analysis using RNA-seq data.
After the installation of necessary R packages, 
the workflow loads the data from the GEO database using the `getGEO` function from 
the `GEOquery` package. 
It then processes the data, extracting specific columns from the phenoData of the series matrix.
The processed data is saved into a workspace file for further use. 
The workflow also includes the functionality to specify the dataset to be 
loaded from the GEO database in a `config.yml` file, 
making the workflow more flexible and adaptable to different datasets.
The workflow is designed to be executed using Snakemake, 
a workflow management system that allows for the automation of complex data analysis pipelines.
